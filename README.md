# Planetary System Simulator-C++
Project of the Programming I course, National University of Costa Rica.

The planetary system simulator is a software developed in C++ using the WINBGIM graphical library. Its purpose is to simulate a basic planetary system, allowing the user to specify the number of planets, moons per planet, asteroid belts and a celestial body that can enter and leave the planetary system.

With this information, the program generates a planetary system where the planets revolve around the sun at different speeds, with their respective moons.
